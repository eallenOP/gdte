1. Creating the plan
    1. I approached the task by looking at a current course I teach and, during everyday teaching practice, identifying areas that needed improvement. These areas became the focus of new learning design.
    2. The main decisions I made during the creation of the plan were around the scope of the learning design. I had to decide how much of the course to focus on, and selected the most important areas in need of change. It was not going to be possible to implement changes over the whole course.
    3. What influenced my decisions about the learning design plan the most was meeting the needs of students. In deciding on the scope and focus of the plan, I was influenced by consideration of that the students' greated needs were in terms of learning design. The other consideration which influenced my decision-making was the needs of stakeholders, primarily employers in the IT industry. Their needs helped me to decide which areas of the learning outcomes, content, activities, communication methods and assessments to focus on in my plan in order to produce the best potential employees.
