1. As a result of the learnings mentioned in [step 2](critical-reflection-step-2.md) there are several actions to take for my future teaching practice. Firstly, incorporating sustainability, learner diversity and cultural aspects into the actual plans for learning design. This will mean that when implementing the plans to do the designing, and then delivering the design, those aspects will carry right through. Secondly, planning to the key factors of the tertiary education context, including ensuring alignment to local and national frameworks for learning. This will also help to ensure the alignment of course components as it will translate into a framework against which to plan learning design.
