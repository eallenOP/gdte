# Learning Design for Teaching in a Tertiary Contextâ€”Elise Allen
## Assessment Task 2: Critical Reflection On The Learning Design Plan

### Step 3: Reflect for action
1. As a result of the learnings mentioned in [step 2](critical-reflection-step-2.md) there are several actions to take for my future teaching practice. Firstly, incorporating sustainability, learner diversity and cultural aspects into the actual plans for learning design. This will mean that when implementing the plans to do the designing, and then delivering the design, those aspects will carry right through. Secondly, planning to the key factors of the tertiary education context, including ensuring alignment to local and national frameworks for learning. This will also help to ensure the alignment of course components as it will translate into a framework against which to plan learning design.
2. The plan is likely to achieve its objectives, as is clear from an assessment and critical analysis of the most important aspects of the plan. Firstly, because the objectives align with other course components, all aspects of the design are set up to ensure the achievement of those objectives. For example, as shown in the matrix in [part 2](learning-design-plan-2.md) of the plan, the activities, content, interaction and assessment are designed to work with cohesion rather than as stand-alone components. Secondly, the objectives themselves have been carefully written in order to be achievable within the parameters of the learning design. This includes both the scope and focus of the objectives, along with the complimentary milestones and deliverables which are realistic and measurable. The risks and pressure points have been carefully considered, as outlined in [part 3](learning-design-plan-3.md), and contingencies planned for to ensure these risks are properly managed. This adds an extra layer of flexibility which contributes to ensuring that the objectives can be met successfully.
3. As mentioned above, the learning design plan has a level of in-built flexibility as well as a solid foundation in current best-practice. This helps to ensure the sustainability of the plan as well as allowing responsiveness to change. For example, educational trends have always changed over time () and it is therefore reasonable to assume that this change will be a predictable constant. The trends on which some of the plan is based may pass, but the foundation of the plan is flexible enough to encompass new and emerging educational theories without compromising the core premise. This premise is based on the requirement to meet stakeholder needs, including the needs of the learners and of industry.
