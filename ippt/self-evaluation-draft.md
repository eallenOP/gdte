# Demonstration of teaching philosophy

My [teaching philosophy](teaching-philosophy.html) (TP) begins by describing learning as a shared process, sometimes beginning with one-way knowledge transfer but with the aim of increasing independence. This can be seen in all my lessons, but a good example is in [Multimedia](https://youtu.be/7SjdVSy-ayg) where I explain some concepts and then get the learners to build on these by doing research of their own. They share this in an online forum, and then I go through it with them to solidify and confirm the learning. 

In this same lesson are some glimpses of the coaching metaphor from my TP, but better examples are difficult to film. One of the best examples is my [lesson plan for oral presentation training](Lesson%20Plan%20PP%2013-1.pdf), which is also a good example of using active learning techniques.

Another example of applying my TP is including experiential learning. This happens in my Professional Practice class where students work on projects together to practice teamwork in an IT context, using industry tools. This is illustrated by this image of students collaborating in class.

# Integration of principles

Although this is covered in more depth in the [evidence and reflection section](evidence-reflection.html), example of principles used in my teaching include using active learning techniques (example: [active participation](https://youtu.be/dJE4mdlmKck) with learners evaluating CV examples), meeting students' future needs (example: revision conducted at the start of the [CV lesson](https://youtu.be/dJE4mdlmKck) shows learning design from earlier in the course) and time on task (boring to film, see photo above). The majority of every lesson I deliver is time spent on task. Very keen readers can see this for a few minutes during a [Multimedia lesson](https://youtu.be/wajj8LN3OSE?t=1703) in which a bit of coaching is also shown, but for the most part I turned off the camera to save the batteries during time on task.

# Reflection

I would much rather spend less time talking in many of these sessions (although for some topics it can't be avoided) however, in previous iterations of the Multimedia course, in particular, when I tried to adhere to my TP even more, feedback from learners was that they would much prefer more passive learning and less independence. Therefore, I am trying here to find a balance that still integrates principles of effective teaching while also leaving the students with an impression of "value for money".

Finding the balance between learner perceived satisfaction and genuine learning is the biggest challenge for me. The most successful mix seems to be a bit of traditional teaching to make the learners feel at home and a bit of modern teaching practice to trick them into learning something anyway. The true mix that I use is not shown in the videos because there would be a lot of film of students experiencing group work. The real part I play in that process is carefully curating the task, the groups and the tools (as mentioned in my TP), which doesn't happen in the classroom but during planning.

# Success?

Although a rushed squish towards the end of semester did not provide the opportunity to demonstrate my very best teaching, I feel I facilitate an inclusive, learner-centered environment and promote learner engagement very well. My classroom management, it has to be said, is exemplary, though it only shows in these videos as an absence of disruption (and in a degree programme this is mostly to be expected anyway). I am also capable of managing thirty exhausted and excited 15-year-olds who have already been away from home for a whole week, but I can't video that before the end of this week. I have been known to have to rescue other teachers, even, at times, when I am a student in their class. I can do this without anyone noticing it as "classroom management". Why do I think this? I have been doing it since I was 16. By the time I was 18 I could silence a room of teenagers with a look.
