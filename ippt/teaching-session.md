The following is a rough cut of an edited lesson. The course is Professional Practice for IT (level 5) and is in the first semester of the first year of the Bachelor of Information Technology. This is a lesson about CVs and personal presentation ([lesson plan](Lesson%20Plan%20PP%2011-2.pdf)).

I have written a [self-evaluation](self-evaluation.html) about how this lesson incorporates aspects of my teaching philosophy and the principles of learning design, facilitation and assessment.
