# Evidence and Reflection on the Integration of Principles

## Learning design
### Using active learning techniques
Chickering and Gamson's (1987) third principle of good practice in undergraduate education is to encourage active learning. I agree with their statement that "Learning is not a spectator sport", and as such I endeavour to include as much active and hands-on learning as possible.

One particularly good example of this is the way I design learning to help learners deliver effective oral presentations. I had noticed that in many courses with oral presentations in them, no actual training had been given on how to be an effective presenter. In some cases, as with the Professional Practice course I took over from a lecturer who retired, presenting skills were taught as theory, and the course offered little chance to learn these skills gradually, preferring instead to simply include one practice and one final presentation after a series of lectures about gestures, vocal qualities and body language.

As my [lesson plan for oral presentation](https://github.com/eallenOP/gdte/raw/master/ippt/Lesson%20Plan%20PP%2012-2.docx) (download) shows, I include a series of active exercises which start very simple and get progressively more challenging. These activities target specific presentation skills, such as the ability to think and talk at the same time, and build up to putting them all together for a small practice presentation in the next session. Reflective questions are included after the more challenging activities to encourage learners to pay attention to their qualities as a presenter.

### Development of capabilities
Kember and McNaught (2007) propose ten principles of effective tertiary teaching, the first of which is "Teaching and curriculum design need to be focused on meeting studentsâ€™ future needs, implying the development in students of generic capabilities such as critical thinking, teamwork and communication skills, amongst others" (as cited in Devlin and Samarawickrema, 2010, p.113). Many examples of this principle in use are evident in my design of the Professional Practice for IT course, as shown by the simplified version of the [course blueprint](PP1%20Blueprint%20v3%202018.pdf).

When I redesigned this course my aim was to identify those core capabilities that are most crucial to the IT industry as well as those that our typical students need to work on the most. In this way, the course is designed to meet the needs of learners in their future courses (this course occurs in their first semester of the degree) and also to carry through to their careers. The skills I identified as particularly important include oral and written communication skills specific to IT, for example writing technical documents, the ability to learn independently ("lifelong learners") including time management and using Google efficiently and so on. The course is organised into stages which match up to groupings of important capabilities: beginning with design thinking, then study or learning skills, followed by workflow, teamwork and project management skills both specific to IT and more general, and lastly the skills associated with presenting oneself and making a good impression, including job applications.
