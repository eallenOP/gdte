# Teaching Philosophy Statement

## Definition of learning

Teaching and learning is a process of guided discovery, a shared process where skills and knowledge pass between people. Sometimes this begins with a relationship of one-way dependence with the aim of increasing independence at a manageable pace, like gradually removing training wheels when learning to ride a bike. Learning can also happen in a group or network with no specified teacher role, knowledge being created by the sharing of ideas. 

## Definition of teaching

Because I come from a background of training, I tend to view my role a bit like a coach or mentor, helping people to discover knowledge for themselves and building learnersâ€™ skills by providing opportunities for practice, feedback and improvement. To achieve this, I like to include a lot of experiential learning and opportunity for reflection.

## Teaching methods

As an IT teacher, blended learning is also a natural fit for my teaching style - using the very technologies I am teaching as a part of the learning process itself. For example, when I teach GitHub, the lesson can take place within GitHub with face-to-face support at the same time.  I prefer to stay away from the idea that there is a single right way to do things or a single correct answer, instead preferring to encourage learners to use a robust decision making process and rewarding them for independent thinking. This is part of the goal of creating life long learners, rather than the traditional model of knowledge being passed from teacher to student, remembered by rote and regurgitated for the purpose of an exam.

## Evaluation and impact

## Metaphors for teaching philosophy

Sherpa guiding learner up the mountain. Coach of a sports team or person.
Teaching/coaching is about providing situations or drills to hone particular muscles (skills or knowledge). It is important for sports people to train - teams hold regular practice and the coach gives feedback to improve certain ways to approach challenges, building from basic skills to advanced patterns. Example: using GitHub to collaborate.
