# Teaching Philosophy Statement

## Definition of learning

Teaching and learning is a process of guided discovery, a shared process where skills and knowledge pass between people. As noted by Northcote and Featherston (2006), teaching and learning are becoming increasingly intertwined, moving away from the traditional uni-directional passage of knowledge. Sometimes learning may begin with a relationship of one-way dependence with the aim of increasing independence at a manageable pace, like gradually removing training wheels when learning to ride a bike. Learning can also happen in a group or network with no specified teacher role, knowledge being created by the sharing of ideas.

This definition is based upon contemporary models of learning design, such as <<<insert>>> (cite), as well as my own personal preferences as a learner. I discovered during my early experiences as a tertiary student that the widely accepted model of note taking and passage copying was not resulting in my retaining information, nor was it helping me to form my own opinions. Once I realised this, I stopped taking notes about the lecture (especially since most of the information could be found in the readings if I forgot anything) and spent more time listening and thinking, only noting down my own thoughts. Of course, when I have had learning environments available to me other than lectures, I have had a different experience. The learning I personally find most enjoyable and productive is participatory, hands-on where possible and driven by but not focussed on the presence of an expert who helps to prompt discussion.

## Definition of teaching

Because I come from a background of youth adventure training, I tend to view my role a bit like a coach or mentor, helping people to discover knowledge for themselves and building learners’ skills by providing opportunities for practice, feedback and improvement. To achieve this, I like to include a lot of experiential learning and opportunity for reflection, as well as opportunity for discussion in small or large groups. My own experiences as a learner reinforces this: for example I often relate to my students that when I was first learning to drive, I did not enjoy getting behind the wheel at all, but forcing myself to practice eventually made driving feel second-nature and my anxiety eventually disappeared. Thus I feel that it's important to curate (not just create) opportunities for learners to put their new skills or knowledge into practice and to learn from early mistakes.

## Teaching methods

As an IT teacher, blended learning is also a natural fit for my teaching style — using the very technologies I am teaching as a part of the learning process itself. For example, when I teach GitHub, the lesson can take place within GitHub with face-to-face support at the same time. GitHub is a great way to leave feedback on student work in exactly the same way they would get feedback if they were, for example, developing open source software. 

I prefer to stay away from the idea that there is a single right way to do things or a single correct answer, instead preferring to encourage learners to use a robust decision making process and rewarding them for independent thinking. This is part of the goal of creating life long learners, rather than the traditional model of knowledge being passed from teacher to student, remembered by rote and regurgitated for the purpose of an exam. This relates to my personal value of independence and self-reliance. I believe that the ability to make robust decisions will benefit learners well after their ability to predict "correct" answers has become obsolete in the real world. For example, the problems we are called upon to face in the IT industry are often "wicked" problems and do not have single correct solutions (Zack, 1998).

## Evaluation and impact



## Metaphors for teaching philosophy

Sherpa guiding learner up the mountain. Coach of a sports team or person.
Teaching/coaching is about providing situations or drills to hone particular muscles (skills or knowledge). It is important for sports people to train - teams hold regular practice and the coach gives feedback to improve certain ways to approach challenges, building from basic skills to advanced patterns. Example: using GitHub to collaborate.
