# Teaching Philosophy Statement

## Definition of learning

Teaching and learning is a process of guided discovery, a shared process where skills and knowledge pass between people. As noted by Northcote and Featherston (2006), teaching and learning are becoming increasingly intertwined, moving away from the traditional uni-directional passage of knowledge. Sometimes learning may begin with a relationship of one-way dependence with the aim of increasing independence at a manageable pace, like gradually removing training wheels when learning to ride a bike. Learning can also happen in a group or network with no specified teacher role, knowledge being created by the sharing of ideas.

This definition is based upon contemporary models of learning design, such as <<<insert>>> (cite), as well as my own personal preferences as a learner. I discovered during my early experiences as a tertiary student that the widely accepted model of note taking and passage copying was not resulting in my retaining information, nor was it helping me to form my own opinions. Once I realised this, I stopped taking notes about the lecture (especially since most of the information could be found in the readings if I forgot anything) and spent more time listening and thinking, only noting down my own thoughts. Of course, when I have had learning environments available to me other than lectures, I have had a different experience. The learning I personally find most enjoyable and productive is participatory, hands-on where possible and driven by but not focussed on the presence of an expert who helps to prompt discussion.

## Definition of teaching

Because I come from a background of youth adventure training, I tend to view my role a bit like a coach or mentor, helping people to discover knowledge for themselves and building learners’ skills by providing opportunities for practice, feedback and improvement. To achieve this, I like to include a lot of experiential learning and opportunity for reflection, as well as opportunity for discussion in small or large groups. My own experiences as a learner reinforces this: for example I often relate to my students that when I was first learning to drive, I did not enjoy getting behind the wheel at all, but forcing myself to practice eventually made driving feel second-nature and my anxiety eventually disappeared. Thus I feel that it's important to curate (not just create) opportunities for learners to put their new skills or knowledge into practice and to learn from early mistakes.

## Perception of the learner

It would be a grave mistake to assume that all students are similar to one another or are similar to myself in terms of their intelligence, motivation, personality and cognitive styles (McKeachie, Pintrich, Lin & Smith , 1986). But in some ways it is a characteristic of human nature to slip back into this view (Ross, Greene & House, 1976), so some effort needs to go into making explicit our perception of the learner so that we can understand where it needs to be corrected.

Intelligence is difficult to measure, and as such there are many different views about what constitutes intelligence (McKeachie, et al., 1986). For the purposes of describing my own perception of the learner, and for the purposes of the kind of teaching I am called upon to do in the Bachelor of Information Technology, I will consider it to be something like a learner's ability to process new information. The speed at which learners can process information, in my experience, can vary greatly. It can be very challenging teaching a cohort of students where the difference in learning speed between the most and least "intelligent" students is great, and in practice I find that it's important to check frequently that the speed of learning I am expecting is correct. I endeavour to do this in a way that does not call attention to either the fastest or slowest learners, for example walking around the classroom to view student work and see for myself whether people need more time to complete activities. Body language and facial affect display are also important for perceiving intelligence at work.

Motivation and personality can also make a big difference both to individual learners and to a cohort. Where a class has a culture of enthusiastic learning as a result of dominant members of the class displaying motivation and having influential personalities, that class cohort can make a lot more progress in a single semester than one with a culture of indifference. For example, semester one of 2018 was a difficult semester in which I felt at times as though I was struggling to make headway with my first year students. The same course this semester feels easy to teach by comparison, and this is corroborated by my colleagues teaching different courses to the same cohorts. Informal discussion about this phenomenon has identified class culture as a significant influence on individual learner motivation (Ushioda, 2009).

## Student-teaching relationship 



## Teaching methods

As an IT teacher, blended learning is also a natural fit for my teaching style — using the very technologies I am teaching as a part of the learning process itself. For example, when I teach GitHub, the lesson can take place within GitHub with face-to-face support at the same time. GitHub is a great way to leave feedback on student work in exactly the same way they would get feedback if they were, for example, developing open source software. 

I prefer to stay away from the idea that there is a single right way to do things or a single correct answer, instead preferring to encourage learners to use a robust decision making process and rewarding them for independent thinking. This is part of the goal of creating life long learners, rather than the traditional model of knowledge being passed from teacher to student, remembered by rote and regurgitated for the purpose of an exam. This relates to my personal value of independence and self-reliance. I believe that the ability to make robust decisions will benefit learners well after their ability to predict "correct" answers has become obsolete in the real world. For example, the problems we are called upon to face in the IT industry are often "wicked" problems and do not have single correct solutions (Zack, 1998).

## Evaluation and impact



## Metaphors for teaching philosophy

Sherpa guiding learner up the mountain. Coach of a sports team or person.
Teaching/coaching is about providing situations or drills to hone particular muscles (skills or knowledge). It is important for sports people to train - teams hold regular practice and the coach gives feedback to improve certain ways to approach challenges, building from basic skills to advanced patterns. Example: using GitHub to collaborate.
